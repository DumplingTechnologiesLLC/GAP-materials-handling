    Prior to founding GaP, Matt and Bret built several privately-held businesses from the ground up, including a nationally acclaimed Commercial Glazing business. Additionally, they acquired businesses to grow their footprint, add geographies, and extend the reach of those companies. Once they decided to sell the businesses, one was sold to a Private Equity Buyer and the other two to Publicly Traded Companies.

  <p>
    Having once walked in&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOUR</mark>&thinsp;shoes, they know the challenges of marketing and successfully selling entrepreneurial, privately owned businesses. The first-hand, real-world experience Matt and Bret have with the unique aspects of operating a privately-held or family-owned operation means this firm is uniquely qualified to understand and represent a successful business like&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOURS</mark>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At GaP, our mission is to provide better representation consistently leading to better results.
 </p>
  <p>
    Our in-house Accounting, Analytics, Finance, and Marketing teams are all manned by prior business owners and seasoned executives who understand the intricacies of selling a business. Our client-to-broker ratio is among the lowest in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, all of this translates into&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOU</mark>&thinsp;getting the absolute best representation in the business.
